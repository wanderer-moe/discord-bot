## Serverless Discord Bot Created with Rust & Cloudflare Workers

[![Rust Report Card](https://rust-reportcard.xuri.me/badge/github.com/wanderer-moe/discord-bot)](https://rust-reportcard.xuri.me/report/github.com/wanderer-moe/discord-bot)

## Setup

- Clone repo `git clone https://github.com/wanderer-moe/discord-bot` and use it in your own repository.
- Install wrangler & create a cf worker for this project
- Modify `wrangler.toml` to match your needs (D1 binding, Worker Name, etc)
- Enter appropiate secrets using `wrangler secret put` for your bots `DISCORD_TOKEN`, `DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID` and `DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY`
- Generate a Cloudflare API based off the "Edit Cloudflare Workers" template, and add it as `CF_API_TOKEN` in your repository secrets, this is used for the github action to deploy the worker.
- Add your Interactions Endpoint URL on your App - this allows interactions to be recieved over POST requests.
- You can publish your worker using `wrangler publish`, then create a POST request to `https://<worker-url>/register` - this will register your application commands with discord.

## Run locally

```bash
wrangler dev
```

## Deploy

```bash
wrangler publish
```

## Actions

There is a github action that will automatically deploy the worker on push to main branch & will check for idiomatic code & formatting on pull requests, as `@cloudflare/wrangler-action` doesn't support rust-wasm workers yet,

A workaround is to run `npx i -g wrangler` where you pass in your `CF_API_TOKEN` repository secret into the env in the action before running `wrangler publish`.
